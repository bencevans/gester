# Contribution guidelines

thank you for wanting to contribute :smile:

### running from source
gester requires >= Node LTS and currently doesn't support Node 10 because of the leveldown dependency

Get the code and install dependencies: 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stripedpajamas/gester.git
$ cd gester
$ npm install
```

to run gester from source:
```bash
npm start
```

if you're playing around, i recommend either sending private messages to yourself or spinning up a new test SSB identity.

### pull requests
if there isn't an existing issue for the problem/feature your PR is for, open one so it can get some discussion and you don't waste time. then link to it in your PR.

make sure your code is [Standard](https://github.com/standard/standard)-linted.
